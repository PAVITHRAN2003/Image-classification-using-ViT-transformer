# ViT-Image-Classification

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the application of a Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification. It focuses on solving the well-known Cats and Dogs dataset, showcasing how a Transformer-based model, originally designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), can be effectively adapted and fine-tuned for computer vision tasks. The project also includes details on model deployment as a web application and a video demonstration.

## Features
* Implementation of image classification using a pre-trained Vision Transformer model.
* Data loading, augmentation, and preprocessing techniques for image datasets compatible with ViT.
* Training and evaluation of the ViT model on the Cats and Dogs dataset.
* Deployment of the trained model as a web application on Hugging Face Spaces for interactive use.
* A recorded video demonstration showcasing the deployed model's functionality.

## Dataset Used
* **Cats and Dogs Dataset**: A widely recognized binary image classification dataset consisting of images of cats and dogs. This dataset is commonly used for benchmarking and learning in computer vision.

## Model Used
* **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: This project utilizes a pre-defined Vision Transformer model (e.g., `vit_b_16` from `torchvision.models` or similar variants available on Hugging Face) for its image classification task. ViT models operate by breaking images into fixed-size patches, linearly embedding them, adding position embeddings, and then feeding the resulting sequence of vectors to a standard Transformer encoder.

## Setup and Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ViT-Image-Classification.git](https://github.com/your-username/ViT-Image-Classification.git)
    cd ViT-Image-Classification
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The project requires the following Python libraries. It's highly recommended to install them within a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision Pillow matplotlib numpy transformers datasets accelerate evaluate
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure you have a suitable environment, preferably with GPU support and CUDA installed for `torch` and `torchvision` if you have an NVIDIA GPU, for efficient model training and inference.)*

## Usage
The core logic for this image classification project is contained within the Jupyter Notebook:
* `Image_Classification_Vit.ipynb`

To run the project:
1.  Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Image_Classification_Vit.ipynb"
    ```
2.  Execute the cells sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess images, fine-tune the ViT model, evaluate its performance, and prepare for deployment.
